## Week 1.
What did we do:
*  Literature search for relevant hand tracking capability/comparison studies.
* Decide to do a simple hand-tracking evaluation study, instead of full motion capture version.
    * Motion capture was too timeconsuming for a preliminary study, and simply hand-tracking evaluation could easily compare many different technologies.
* Setup development environment

TODO for next week:
* Investigate which hand versions (1.0, 2.0) can be used with which HMD, and how to distinguish them.
* Implemented OpenXR handtracking.
* Develop study details (sphere target + data collection)
